[Q.1] Write a program to implement the groupBy function. (using any key) Create a function named 'groupBy' which accepts the below array and the key name as an input and returns the output like below.

  INPUT = [
    {name: 'abc', address: 'sss'},
    {name: 'abc', address: 'sss1'},
    {name: 'xyz', address: 'sss2'},
  ];

If I called that function like groupBy(INPUT,  'name') // sending name as a keyName, It would be the address or any key present in the object.
